GRID_DOMINANCE [[TODO]]
=======================


[X] WorldBackground correct Render
[X] Only draw visible entities
[X] World Map Node Entities
[X] Level are nodes on grid => bigger than cannons - should be easily clickable by touch !!!
[X] draggable
[X] ring around level button, 4 segments, one for each difficulty
[X] show diff buttons on click -> extend rectangular segments outwards
[X] smooth overdrag (autom push back into bounds)
[X] spell game name with particles on base view
      - Particle system
      - draw leetters by having their path stored nin game
      - text appears like written by delaying path draw
[X] connect level round buttons with pipes (or with CPU grid particles ?)
[X] pipe becomes active when levl cleared on at least one diff
[X] whole map not forcible rectangulare (but 90° edges)
[X] background like in level, cleared levels convert background (diff = different color or higher intensity or higher reach) -> or diff=lighter color (?)
[X] only draw what is visible
[X] when level node is clicked center it on scren and move bar on top and bottom into screen where you can see (levelname | difficulty | what you have solved | percentage solved worldwide | etc)
      - normal draging removes bars again (slide in slide out)
      - clicking on otehr node in range opens that one and centers taht one and show that ones info
[X] For first few levels (all ?) only unlock diff 3-4 when one is done
[/] Add floating button to find next free level - auto drag following tree to next unsolved level node (aka fastest path)
[/] If multiple leafs each click moves view and focus to the next
[/] Worldmap starts with logo view - but animation is non-blocking you can always start dragging
      - animation is letter drawing with particles
      - and after animation if not dragged autom move to next free level
[X] Root node in level returns to map
[X] needs topic: particles
[X] needs topic: screen with offset
[X] needs topic: drag events
[X] No dim+energysaving while active
[X] Possible Names:
      - Grid Dominance
      - Bullet Swipe
      - Cannon Conquest   <--
      - Shoot and Conquer
[X] Online account
      - automatic create initial
      - by device id
      - later add username + pw for reuse
      - save levels solved, points, times online
      - daily (/hourly?) cronjob to calc stats
      - php backend
      - log into other acc with pw
[X] Online crash log 
      - by php send mail (always or daily report ??)
      - username, log, device, resolution, android version, etc
[X] Less cannoncog frames in spritesheet (mirror on axis) (does not work with less than hd ??)
[X] winning HUD
      - HUD COntainer
      - Dyn create blur background from 9 pieces (use for pauseButtons)
      - Dyn create rounded border panels (use for pauseButtons)
      - see sample win hud
          - Diff levels clickable
          - On new diff achieve icon pop-grows (swiggle function) and +score indicator is visible (and animated ?)
[X] Sound effects
[X] Background music
[X] Score
[X] Menu
      - Account
      - Attributions
      - Highscore
      - Settings
[X] Different spritesheet scales for diff devices
[X] different tower types
[X] Level select wie Sokobond, drag around
      - Level build a tree
      - some (3) branches must be bought per in-app-buy, or buy full eversion with everything
      - dead ends and master level with two roots
[X] Levels in plaintext, code like format
      - Level Editor / Level Live Preview tool
[/] Digital World (like World of Goo)
[X] Art Style wie Tron? - somth simplistic
      - On Cannon shoot eject particles in color on grid
      - particles follow grid lines
      - particles split into smaller ones on intersections
      - tiles get colors from surrounding particles
      - enemy particles neutralize each other
      - whole map gets colored in sections of the fractions naturally
[X] Laser Cannons
      - Continoous damage
      - Lasers combine
      - Lasers reflect each other
      - Reflecting Walls
      - Refracting walls -> Glass Walls
          - (game machanic: bullets feflect, lasers only refract)
[/] Destructible Turrets
      - Can't convert - only destroy
[X] Smaller turrets, bullets have less weight
[X] Shield Turrets
      - Protect other turret from damage
      - Dont shoot itself
      - Shield turret can't form loop (shielded turret can's shield other turret)
[X] root node in level returns to overworld map
[/] Tutorial in first three level (icon anim for drag | text for whoot enemy | text for capture neutral | etxt for boost own cannons)
[X] Make Cannon Bullet power dependent on cannon size (no change for current defaault size, but big mama should one or twoshot enemy cannon), perhaps also shoot with less freq
[X] Better Icons for 4 diff (1+4 is ok)
[/] Zoom in should start mid pinch (once power is big enough) not when release finger
[X] Fix stretched splash screen (+ better splash image -> BFB logo (evtl bfb animation ???))
[X] Größere Hitbox pause button
[X] evtl größere buttons for speed (klein aufm handy)
[X] Diff cannon sizes
[X] Walls
[X] kill walls
[X] portal walls (can have multi-in | multi-out)
[X] Glass Walls make reflection+refraction for lasers (splitting laser in to differently powerful lasers)
[X] True mirror walls for lasers
[X] endless level (donut)
[/] shoot 4 way cannon
[X] spreadshot cannon
[X] minigun cannon with cooldown
[/] rotating + moving walls
[/] rotating and moving cannons
[X] Unlock Worlds when previous word is 100% (and remark in unlock screen -> button+move to world+toast)
[X] Pipes darker when powered 
[X] Toast description when clikcing on number in info panel
[X] Cannon that only barrel charges when boosted
[X] Level 2-22::  background looks strange (no background blocking for neutral cannons ??)
[?] inAppBilling Regression ??
[ ] viewport stretched with onscreen hardkeys
[X] Unlock lower difficulties when solving higher ones
[X] README.md
[ ] AppStore stuff
[ ] Levels W4
[X] Relay cannon delay
[X] Prevent relay cannon game_draw (or recognize it)
[ ] Some grid arms with red AI | some with yellow (but still most with blue)
[ ] perhaps show ai cols in graph
