WORLD MAP
---------

 - Level are nodes on grid => bigger than cannons - should be easily clickable by touch !!!
 - draggable
 - ring around level button, 4 segments, one for each difficulty
 - show diff buttons on click -> extend rectangular segments outwards
 - smooth overdrag (autom push back into bounds)
 - spell game name with particles on base view
    - Particle system
    - draw leetters by having their path stored nin game
    - text appears like written by delaying path draw
 - connect level round buttons with pipes
 - pipe becomes active when levl cleared on at least one diff
 - whole map not forcible rectangulare (but 90Â° edges)
 - background like in level, cleared levels convert background (diff = different color or higher intensity or higher reach)
 - only draw what is visible

=> needs topic: particles
=> needs topic: screen with offset
=> needs topic: drag events


TODO NEXT

 - Less cannoncog frames in spritesheet (mirror on axis) (does not work with less than hd ??)
 - winning HUD
    -> HUD COntainer
    -> Dyn create blur background from 9 pieces (use for pauseButtons)
    -> Dyn create rounded border panels (use for pauseButtons)
    -> see sample win hud
        - Diff levels clickable
        - On new diff achieve icon pop-grows (swiggle function) and +score indicator is visible (and animated ?)

 - menu
 - levels
 - score
 - sound

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Different spritesheet scales for diff devices

mit ton + musik

different tower types

Level select wie Sokobond, drag around
	- Level build a tree
	- some (3) branches must be bought per in-app-buy, or buy full eversion with everything
	- dead ends and master level with two roots

Levels in plaintext, code like format
	-> Level Editor / Level Live Preview tool

Digital World (like World of Goo)

Art Style wie Tron? - somth simplistic
	On Cannon shoot eject particles in color on grid
	particles follow grid lines
	particles split into smaller ones on intersections
	tiles get colors from surrounding particles
	enemy particles neutralize each other
	whole map gets colored in sections of the fractions naturally

Special Stuff:
	Laser Cannons
		Continoous damage
		Lasers combine
		Lasers reflect each other
		Reflecting Walls
		Refracting walls -> Glass Walls
			(game machanic: bullets feflect, lasers only refract)
	Destructible Turrets
		Can't convert - only destroy
	Smaller turrets, bullets have less weight
	Shield Turrets
		Protect other turret from damage
		Dont shoot itself
		Shield turret can't form loop (shielded turret can's shield other turret)
