TODO

Pseudo binary serialize

linear data
char by char
utf8
perhaps pretty format linebrak after 80
int = len + number
most everything = len + data
add version number to start and to every property for old loafd (juwopu style)

TODO NEXT

 - Less cannoncog frames in spritesheet (mirror on axis) (does not work with less than hd ??)
 - winning HUD
    -> HUD COntainer
    -> Dyn create blur background from 9 pieces (use for pauseButtons)
    -> Dyn create rounded border panels (use for pauseButtons)
    -> see sample win hud
        - Diff levels clickable
        - On new diff achieve icon pop-grows (swiggle function) and +score indicator is visible (and animated ?)

 - menu
 - levels
 - score
 - sound

Different spritesheet scales for diff devices

mit ton + musik

different tower types

Level select wie Sokobond, drag around
	- Level build a tree
	- some (3) branches must be bought per in-app-buy, or buy full eversion with everything
	- dead ends and master level with two roots

Levels in plaintext, code like format
	-> Level Editor / Level Live Preview tool

Digital World (like World of Goo)

Art Style wie Tron? - somth simplistic
	On Cannon shoot eject particles in color on grid
	particles follow grid lines
	particles split into smaller ones on intersections
	tiles get colors from surrounding particles
	enemy particles neutralize each other
	whole map gets colored in sections of the fractions naturally

Special Stuff:
	Laser Cannons
		Continoous damage
		Lasers combine
		Lasers reflect each other
		Reflecting Walls
		Refracting walls -> Glass Walls
			(game machanic: bullets feflect, lasers only refract)
	Destructible Turrets
		Can't convert - only destroy
	Smaller turrets, bullets have less weight
	Shield Turrets
		Protect other turret from damage
		Dont shoot itself
		Shield turret can't form loop (shielded turret can's shield other turret)
