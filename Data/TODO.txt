Art Style wie Tron? - somth simplistic
	On Cannon shoot eject particles in color on grid
	particles follow grid lines
	particles split into smaller ones on intersections
	tiles get colors from surrounding particles
	enemy particles neutralize each other
	whole map gets colored in sections of the fractions naturally

Special Stuff:
	Laser Cannons
		Continoous damage
		Lasers combine
		Lasers reflect each other
		Reflecting Walls
		Refracting walls -> Glass Walls
			(game machanic: bullets feflect, lasers only refract)
	Destructible Turrets
		Can't convert - only destroy
	Smaller turrets, bullets have less weight
	Shield Turrets
		Protect other turret from damage
		Dont shoot itself
		Shield turret can't form loop (shielded turret can's shield other turret)
